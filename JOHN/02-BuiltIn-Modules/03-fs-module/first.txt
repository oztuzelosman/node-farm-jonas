Hey I'm Osman from Turkey. I have been learning front-end  technologies since July 2021.  I have been learning techs like HTML/Css/Js/React/Git/Github/Linux/Docker on Udemy. I would like to become MERN stack dev so I have started learning Node. I will do my best for your team. Thanks for giving me a chance.
