Hi everyone, I'm a professional software developer from the UK who's worked on full-stack applications for over 5 years. Currently working on government software for Belgium, Norway and Australia with .NET and Angular but Ive got experience in Python, JavaScript, etc.

If a team needs help with their project, code needs reviewing, or anything else. drop me a message and I'll assist in any way I can ðŸ™‚
